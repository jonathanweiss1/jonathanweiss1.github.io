A folder that has been split like this is just one large file that has been cut into multiple parts. So just take those parts and stick them back together:</p>\n<p class=\"mb-6\">Navigate to the folder where your zip is located. The files should look something like this:</p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code   >\n          <code slot=\"code\">    data.zip.001\r\n    data.zip.002\r\n    data.zip.003</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p class=\"mb-6\">If you are on windows and the files are located on a local drive, use:</p>\n<p class=\"mb-6\"><code class=\"bg-slate-200 text-slate-600 px-2 py-1 rounded-md\">copy /b data.zip.001+data.zip.002+data.zip+003 data.zip</code>\r\nto join them.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-6\">If the files are located on a remote drive, use:\r\n<code class=\"bg-slate-200 text-slate-600 px-2 py-1 rounded-md\">copy /b /z data.zip.001+data.zip.002+data.zip+003 data.zip</code></p>\n<p class=\"mb-6\">Header image created by Smashicons on <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/zip-format\">Flaticon</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/recombine-split-zip-folders","title":"How to recombine split zip folders"},"parent":{}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e0ae980c-1b4b-5f7f-93b2-e9747c5e96f1","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/recombine-split-zip-folders","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1780103658"],"slicesMap":{}}
